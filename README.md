After you have deposited funds to your checkings account you can either move them to your savings account or withdraw.

**Note:** If you try to withdraw more funds than your checkings account has it will give you an error message and stop the transaction.
Also if you choose savings account and try to withdraw funds from there the program will again throw you an error message and stop the transaction since
you are not allowed to withdraw funds from savings using this program.
